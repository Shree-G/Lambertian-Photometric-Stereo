# Lambertian Photometric Stereo

## Objective

This project is aimed to implement Lambertian Photometric Stereo. This is a technique that is used to estimate the surface normals of an object given three (or more) photos of that object in different lighting conditions (along with the coordinates of the light source in relation to the object itself).

### Skills Learned

-  Complex linear algebra to derive surface normals and albedo from multiple images under varying light conditions.
-  Processed and Manipulated image data, specifically in extracting and using light source information to derive physical properties of surfaces.
-  Python programming skills, including the use of libraries such as NumPy for matrix operations and Matplotlib for visualizing results in 2D and 3D.
-  Visualized complex datasets effectively, such as using 3D plots and quivers to represent the orientation and magnitude of surface normals as well as depth maps for surface reconstruction.

### Tools Used

- Numpy
- MatPlotLib
- Pickle
- 3-D Visualization Tools (mpl_toolkits.mplot3d)
